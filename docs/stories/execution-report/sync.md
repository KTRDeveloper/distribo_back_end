## SYNC-001 — Sync types, adapter registry and viewer

- Filed: 2026-10-04 17:01 UTC
- Status: **done**: types, registry, viewer; 7 tests pass
- Risk: medium · story: [SYNC-001-sync-types-adapter-registry-and-viewer.md](../modules/sync/SYNC-001-sync-types-adapter-registry-and-viewer.md)
- Agent: 34,567 tokens, 18 tool uses, 6 min 25 s

### Agent report

**Summary:** Added sync types, adapter registry and viewer builder; all tests green.

**Decisions:**
- Viewer shape: followed the Context (memberships carry `status: 'ACTIVE'`, `isOnline: false`), a superset of the Implementation type; role typed as Prisma `CollaborationRole`.
- `Row`, `TableChange`, `PushContext`: the story names them without defining them; chose minimal shapes (`TableChange` = table + created/updated/deleted, `PushContext` = viewer + tx) for later SYNC stories to refine.
- getAdapter also throws SYNC_UNKNOWN_TABLE for a valid table with no adapter registered (fail closed).
- Registry and unknown-table tests ("unit" in the story) sit in the one integration file the story lists; they use `vi.resetModules` for a fresh registry.

**Tests added beyond the story:**
- `tests/integration/sync/registry-viewer.test.ts` › answers 404 for an unknown person: fail closed (CONVENTIONS Errors)
- same › returns no membership for a person with none: empty case
- same › known table with no adapter throws; registering a name outside the 14 tables throws; `__proto__` lookup rejected: registry fail closed

**Other additions:**
- `src/modules/sync/sync.repository.ts`: the only prisma caller, since CONVENTIONS reserve prisma calls to repositories.

**Evidence:** story tests 7/7; full suite 2139/2139 (first run had 1 failure, quality-gates lint, caused by 4 lint errors in my test, fixed and re-run green); typecheck clean; lint 0 errors, 60 warnings (pre-existing)

**Follow-ups:**
- buildViewer throws 404 NOT_FOUND for an unknown person; the story does not specify it.
