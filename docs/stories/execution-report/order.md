| story | status | commit | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| ORD-001 Orders table | done | bcc80d2 | orders table, enums, FKs, indexes, triggers; 16 tests |
| ORD-002 Order status, cancellation and delivery rules in the database | blocked | 305910b | Story tests pass (35/35) but 2 ORD-001 tests in order-table.test.ts contradict C-16/C-17: 'accepts every documented status' (DELIVERED/CANCELLED/PENDING inserted without their columns) and 'accepts delivered_by_id and cancelled_by_id of a registered person' (set on CONFIRMED). Not under Tests to update: list them, or say how to proceed |

Not run: ORD-003..ORD-021.
Also in this run: relationship, admin, catalog, finance, delivery.

- Run completed: every PLAN line was run or skipped; 24 done, 3 blocked (REL-004, ADM-008, ORD-002), 73 skipped, never three not-done in a row.
- Skipped, dependency not done (stay todo): REL-006..REL-013, REL-015..REL-025 (behind REL-004); CAT-003..CAT-011 (behind REL-006); ORD-003..ORD-021, FIN-002..FIN-010, FIN-012, FIN-013, FIN-015..FIN-020, DLV-002..DLV-010 (behind ORD-002 or REL stories).
- Stashes: "REL-004 blocked: partial changes", "ADM-008 blocked: partial changes", "ORD-002 blocked: partial changes".
- REL-004 and ORD-002 are blocked the same way: extra tests the previous table story added (REL-001, ORD-001) contradict the new rules and are not under "Tests to update".
- ADM-008 needs a human decision: event name admin.2fa_recovered breaks the NTF-002 grammar (e.g. admin.totp_recovered).
- ADM-005's agent stopped with background work running and notified a second time later, with no new tool use; its work likely overlapped a full-suite run of ADM-007 (ADM-007 discarded one contaminated run).
- ADM-007's evidence said the full suite was not rerun after its last fix; the orchestrator ran npm test before the commit: 1161/1161.
- REL-014 left a checksum drift for its migration in the test DB (migration edited after it was applied); set-aside since then reset test_db.
- ADM-006 route POST /admin/auth/login is not in OpenAPI or the catalog test (story defers to ADM-015); not verified after ADM-015 (grep on openapi.json refused, a generated file).
- npm audit --audit-level=high fails (84 vulnerabilities) through @opentelemetry/auto-instrumentations-node, a direct dependency not in the CONVENTIONS allowlist; pre-existing.
- Lint warnings grew from 44 to 57 during the run (agents call them pre-existing).
- To confirm: REL-005 money as number in views and driver view showing customer_label; ADM-014 suspend of a CLOSED organization answers 409; FIN-011 expenses not revoked for DELETE/TRUNCATE.
- Next: list the two REL-001 tests under REL-004 "Tests to update", the two ORD-001 tests under ORD-002, pick the ADM-008 event name; then /implement-stories REL-004,ORD-002,ADM-008 and /implement-stories next:100.

- Stopped after REL-002: blocked, a REL-001 test (`relationship-table.test.ts` › "rejects an unknown merged_into_id with 23503 and accepts an existing one") conflicts with the new CHECKs and the story does not list it under "Tests to update".
- Not reached: REL-003 to DLV-009 (98 stories), because the run stopped on the block; no `--keep-going`.
- Nothing unexpected: the agent report and the notification figures both came in.
- REL-002's migration, test file and schema.prisma comment are left uncommitted in the working tree, waiting for the human decision.
- Next: decide whether that REL-001 test may be updated (amend REL-002's "Tests to update"), then `/implement-stories REL-002` and `/implement-stories next:100`.

## ORD-001 — Orders table

- Filed: 2026-10-04 09:55 UTC
- Status: **done**: orders table, enums, FKs, indexes, triggers; 16 tests
- Risk: medium · story: [ORD-001-orders-table.md](../modules/order/ORD-001-orders-table.md)
- Agent: 42,422 tokens, 14 tool uses, 11 min 10 s

### Agent report

**Summary:** Added the `orders` table (model Order, migration 20261004220000_ord_001_orders) with enums, FKs, indexes and triggers.

**Decisions:**
- Enum names: new `OrderParty` (CUSTOMER/SUPPLIER, used by placed_by_party and cancelled_by_party) and `OrderStatus`; not reusing RelationshipParty to keep modules independent.
- Invalid enum values are asserted as 22P02 (story says only "rejects").
- Text columns (notes, reason, sync_issue) use `@db.Text`; FKs keep Prisma defaults (nullable ones ON DELETE SET NULL).
- Registered-person guard is a deferred constraint trigger (as REL/CAT tables), so the guest check fires at commit.

**Tests added beyond the story:**
- `tests/integration/order/order-table.test.ts` › accepts every documented status: all 5 status values insertable (Order.status:enum); passed at once
- same file › delivered_by_id/cancelled_by_id guest rejected 23514 and registered accepted (C-04); null delivery_cost/status 23502 (Order:required); server_updated_at moves on update (C-35); indexes exist

**Evidence:** story tests 16/16; full suite 1332/1332, failing: none; typecheck clean; lint 0 errors, 55 warnings (pre-existing)

## ORD-002 — Order status, cancellation and delivery rules in the database

- Filed: 2026-10-04 12:26 UTC
- Status: **done**: CHECKs and status trigger on orders; 1510 tests pass
- Risk: high · story: [ORD-002-order-status-cancellation-and-delivery-rules-in.md](../modules/order/ORD-002-order-status-cancellation-and-delivery-rules-in.md)
- Agent: 53,549 tokens, 17 tool uses, 16 min 7 s

### Agent report

**Summary:** Added migration 20261004280000_ord_002_status_rules (6 CHECKs + BEFORE UPDATE status trigger), status-rules tests, updated the 3 listed order-table tests and the Order comment in schema.prisma.

**Decisions:**
- "sync_issue set in the same update": trigger requires NEW.sync_issue IS NOT NULL (not that it differs from OLD); the story does not say more.
- CANCELLED to DELIVERED: the trigger clears the four cancellation columns itself, so a caller cannot leave half a cancellation behind; the CHECKs still guard it.
- "Reason empty" is read as NULL (no blank-string rule invented).
- Frozen check compares to_jsonb(NEW) and to_jsonb(OLD) minus supplier_note, sync_issue, server_updated_at, so deleted_at and every other column are frozen too (as the story says: "otherwise only").
- DELIVERED to any other status is refused (only DELIVERED to CANCELLED is named, but the step list is exhaustive).

**Tests added beyond the story:**
- `status-rules.test.ts` › cancellation columns: person empty, party empty, cancelled_by_id / cancelled_at on CONFIRMED (C-16 "all set iff CANCELLED"); passed with the migration
- `status-rules.test.ts` › moving a supplier-placed order to PENDING (C-17 on UPDATE)
- `status-rules.test.ts` › steps: PENDING to IN_DELIVERY, CONFIRMED to PENDING, IN_DELIVERY to PENDING, DELIVERED to CONFIRMED, CANCELLED to PENDING refused (CM-12 permitted steps only)
- `status-rules.test.ts` › CANCELLED to DELIVERED clears the cancellation columns; non-frozen order stays editable
- `status-rules.test.ts` › crafted updates: revive with cleared columns, edit total/delivered_at/deleted_at of DELIVERED, cancel DELIVERED with cancellation columns filled (AB-1)

**Other additions:**
- schema.prisma: plain-language comment above `Order` for the new rules (CLAUDE.md rule).

**Evidence:** story tests 42/42 (order-table 16/16); full suite 1510/1510, failing: none; typecheck clean; lint 0 errors, 57 warnings (existing)

**Follow-ups:**
- FK `cancelled_by_id`/`delivered_by_id` use ON DELETE SET NULL; deleting a person would now violate the pair CHECKs (people are not deleted today).
- Running two integration files in one vitest command once gave a deadlock on shared fixture IDs; single files and the full suite are fine.
